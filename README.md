# apriori_algorithm
implementation of apriori algorithm in R without using package:

#In this programming assignment, you will implement the apriori algorithm to mine association rules from scratch (supp=0.1, which is the minimum support of rules; 2) conf=0.8, which is the minimum confidence of rules). Use your own implementation of apriori algorithm to answer the following questions:

1. Implementation of apriori algorithm. List all the association rules in a table, for each rule, please calculate support, confidence and lift.

2. Suppose that we are interested in only rules with right-hand-side (rhs) indicating survival, either "Survived=No" or "Survived=Yes”, please list those rules, together with support, confidence and lift.

3. For each rule derived in Q2, extend the calculation to other interestingness measures as summarized in Table 5 of Tan et al. 2002 (Tan, P.-N., Kumar, V., and Srivastava, J. (2002). Selecting the right interestingness measure for association patterns. In KDD ’02: Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 32–41, New York, NY, USA. ACM Press.) 

4. Bonus: what measure(s) are more suitable for this data set? Stat your reasons.
